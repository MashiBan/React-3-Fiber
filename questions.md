### What is @ at the beginning of  "npm install three@0.166 @react-three/fiber@8.16" -> " @react-three/fiber@8.16 " ?
 @ at the beginning means that it's the part of a bigger system( which we call scope ) named react-three
 /fiber is the part we are currently retrieving

### React three fiber hooks
for adding parameters of shapes we can rely on three.js documentation like 
first three parameters of SphereGeometry are
    1. radius
    2. widthSegments
    3. heightSegments

     <sphereGeometry args={ [ 1.5, 32, 32 ] }/> //radius, width, height 
            <meshBasicMaterial/>

in case of geometry be carefull not to update those values too much or animate them, Each change will result in whole geomtry being rebuilt.


     <meshBasicMaterial args={ [ { color:'blue', wireframe: true} ] }

     we can totlly do this ^ but we don't do so because it makes the code messy

     we should do -
     <meshBasicMaterial color="mediumpurple" wireframe={true}/>

#### to scale
how we used to do
    mesh.scale.set(3, 2, 1);
now how we do it-
    <mesh scale={[1.5,1.5,1.5]}>
     now how if we have repeating values we can just put 
      <mesh scale={1.5}>

#### for changing the position 

 <mesh position={ [ -2, 0, 0 ]} scale={ 1.5 }>

 but if we want specific postion to change

  <mesh position-x={2} scale={ 1.5 }>

  ### useFrame from @react-three/fiber

  #### orbitContols
  earlier we saw that orbit control isn't the part of the default Three.js classes , We needed to import it seperately.
